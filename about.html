          Welcome to Simple Blackjack! The goal is to get your hand total as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Here's how it works:
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Card Values:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Number Cards (2-9, and the '10'):</strong> Count as their face value.</li>
            <li><strong>Face Cards (Jack, Queen, King):</strong> Each counts as 10.</li>
            <li><strong>Ace:</strong> Counts as 11 initially. If your total sum exceeds 21, an Ace's value will automatically change to 1 if that prevents you from busting.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <strong>Gameplay:</strong>
          <br />
          1. Click "START GAME" on the main page. You'll be dealt two cards.
          <br />
          2. If your sum is less than 21, the message "Do you want to draw a new card?" appears. You can click "NEW CARD" to get another card (this is called a "Hit").
          <br />
          3. <strong>Winning & Losing:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>If your sum is exactly 21 (Blackjack!), you win that round.</li>
            <li>If your sum goes over 21 (Bust!), you're out for that round.</li>
            <li>You can keep drawing cards as long as your sum is below 21.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Good luck!
